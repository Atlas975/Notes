# Vulnerability analysis
- Focuses on identifying, quantifying, and prioritising the vulnerabilities in a system. This is vital for avoiding potential security issues in the future 
- This is carried out by looking for holes that can be exploited (eg missing patches) as well as higher level issues such as what systems are connected to it and who has authorised access

## Security policies
- Policies that help avoid potential vulnerabilities in a system 
- This also involves a **security requirement analysis** which consists of: 
	- Identifying assets and their value 
	- Identifying vulnerabilities, threats and risk priorities 
	- Identifying legal and contractual requirements
- These security requirements may be complex and may have to be abstracted into high-level security policy in order to handle these risks
