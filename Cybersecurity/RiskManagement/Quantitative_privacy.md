# Quantitative privacy
- Involves using numerical methods to measure and ensure individual privacy in datasets
- Focuses on [[Risk_management|risk assessment]] and the application of privacy-preserving techniques to balance the utility of data with the need to protect individual identities when data is shared publicly
- This also needs to avoid **linkage attacks** where anonymised data is correlated with an individual

## K-anonymity
- Handles privacy with equivalence classes, these are sets of records with the same non-sensitive attributes. Each of these classes must have at least k individuals
- Techniques:
	- **Suppression**: Hiding information by replacing it with asterisks or other placeholders.
	- **Generalisation**: replace non-sensitive attribute wi
- This can still lead to linkage attacks such as when a category contains the same sensitive data for all individuals in a class (eg class 3 here, guaranteed to have cancer)

## Ell diversity
- Ell $(\ell)$ diversity is an extension of K-anonymity where each equivalent class must contain $\ell$ unique values for their sensitive attributes 
- This susceptible to linkage attacks such as when the datasets's statistical distrinitoo
