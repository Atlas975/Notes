# Cyber threat analysis
- The process of threat assessment, this is needed to inform the [[Risk_management|risk management]] process to identify likely threat culprits 
- A threat actor can be either malicious or accidental and has the opportunity to exploit potential [[Vulnerability_analysis|vulnerabilities]] in a system
## Time analysis
- Cyber threats can be challenging to prepare for due to having an unobservable build up and a lower threshold to initiate than physical attacks
- The flexibility of being able to attack from any location without having to move physical resources can also make planning against these attacks difficult
- Overall, the short timescale to deploy attacks means that preparation must be done beforehand 
## Intelligence creation
- The process by which raw data is turned into actionable insights for decision-makers
- This generally follows several key stages 
	1. **Planning and direction**: Identify the intelligence needs of decision-makers / set priorities
	2. **Collection**: collect raw data from various sources
	3. **Processing**: Â transform raw data into a usable format eg translation, decryption
	4. **Analysis**: evaluate and interpret processed data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
	5. **Dissemination**: share the analysed intelligence with relevant decision-makers

- This cycle is continuous and iterative, allowing for constant refinement and adaptation based on new information and changing needs
- The goal is to provide decision-makers with accurate, timely, and relevant intelligence to inform policy and operational decision

### Intelligence funnel 
- The intelligence cycle model fails to consider real-time policy decision-making.  The funnel model addresses these issues by incorporating the external environment and continuous feedback 
- This better reflects the dynamic nature of intelligence processing and policy-making and is also able to handle potential counter-intelligence efforts.

## Data sources
- Data sources are required for intelligence that's fed into threat analysis
- These vary in both structure (ease of processing) and trustworthiness 
- Untrustworthy data can still be of use by assigning a lower weight to it's priority

## Threat maturity
- Measures how mature an organisation is in intercepting threats 
- This can be represented by levels of increasing robustness
