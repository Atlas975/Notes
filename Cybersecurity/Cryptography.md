# Cryptography
- The study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security.
- Provides confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, authorisation, and non-repudiation

## Cryptosystem Components
- A cryptosystem is a five-tuple (P, C, K, E, D), where P is plain texts, C is cipher texts, K is key space, E is encryption function, and D is decryption function
- Central to security, based on **Kerckhoffâ€™s principle** (should be secure even if everything about the system except the key is public knowledge)

$$E_{k}:P\to C,k\in K$$
$$D_{k}:C\to P,k\in K$$
## Cryptography functions
- **Encryption:** implement confidentiality in messages
- **Authentication**: verify claimed identities of parties
- **Digital signatures**: prevent tampering and provide non-repudiation 
## Cryptosystem goals
- **Confidentiality**: ensure only authorised users have information access 
- **Integrity**: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information 
- **Availability**: ensure authorised users are able to access information

## Cipher block chaining (CBC)
- Ensures recurring blocks produce distinct ciphertext's
- This becomes vital in preventing repeat encryption patterns from being found
