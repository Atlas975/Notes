# Security management
- The discipline focused on protecting an organisation's assets (ie people, facilities, technology, and dataâ€”through risk assessment, policy development, and implementation of security controls
- The coordinated activities used to implement the suitable controls and treat information security risks are known as the elements of ==information security management==


## Information security
- Involves the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets weather through storage, processing or transmission
- This security is carried out through the application of policy, SETA (security education, training and awareness) and technology
## Safety vs security
- **Security** typically concerns the protection of an entity against intentional  / malicious attacks
- Passwords are an example of a function that may be insecure but unintentionally so 
- **Safety** concerns protection of an entity caused by accidental events
- A system can be safe but not secure eg:
	- A website that only displays information is safe, but not secure if it uses [[Hypertext_transfer_protocol|HTTP]] instead of [[Hypertext_transfer_protocol#HTTPS|HTTPS]] meaning a users connection isn't encrypted 
	- An unlocked house is safe from the dangers of fire or collapse, but it's not secure because it lacks protection from intruders
