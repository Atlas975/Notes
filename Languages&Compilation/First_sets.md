# First sets
- The [[Sets|set]] of terminals that can appear as the first terminal of a string derived by a given rule 
- Also known as the **Left Terminal Set** as it contains terminals that appear left of a rule
- In terms of programming `First(IF boolean THEN statement)` would contain `IF`

## First set rules 
1. If $\alpha$ is a terminal, FIRST($\alpha$) = $\{ \alpha \}$
2. If $\alpha$ is a non-terminal and $\alpha\to\beta$ is a production, add FIRST($\beta$) to FIRST($\alpha$).
3. If $\alpha$ â†’ $\epsilon$ is a production, then $\epsilon$ is in First($\alpha$).
4. If $\alpha$ is a sequence of grammar symbols ($\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2 ... \alpha_{n}$), add FIRST($\alpha_{1}$) to FIRST($\alpha$), then if $\alpha_{1}$ can derive $\epsilon$, add FIRST($\alpha_{2}$) and so on until a non-$\epsilon$-deriving symbol is found

## First set usage
- First sets are used to determine which production rule to apply when a particular terminal is encountered at the beginning of a string.
- These guide the parser in selecting the correct production based on the current input symbol.
