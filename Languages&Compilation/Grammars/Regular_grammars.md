# Regular grammars
- Generates regular languages, non-terminals can be considered as [[Finite_state_machines|states]]. If a FSR can accept an infinite length string it must contain at least one loop ie `A->aA`
- All productions are in one of the following formats (only non-terminals are capital):

$$\text{NON-TERMINAL}\to \text{terminal}\text{ } \text{NON-TERMINAL}$$
$$\text{NON-TERMINAL}\to \text{terminal}$$


## Language of a grammar
- The [[Formal_languages#Language|language]] generated by a grammar is the set containing all strings of terminal symbols
- Parsing with a regular grammar involves determining if a string is grammatical or not, a string is only grammatical according to a given grammar if a path from the start to end symbol exists
- For grammar G the language generated by it is denoted by **L(G)**

## Repeat state theorem - "vwx"
- A string that is accepted can be expressed as 3 concatenated sub strings (vwx)
	- V: string accepted before repeat state(s)
	- W: the repeated string
	- X: string accepted after repeat state(s) 
- Note that while v and x may be empty, w is always non-empty
- This theorem also tells us whether or not a language is regular, for instance $\{ a^ib^{i}\text{ : }i\geq{1} \}$ is not regular as an FSM can only count by entering a new state, meaning it cannot parse this expression. The same logic also shows that regular grammars cannot match parenthesis

## Regular grammar diagrams
- A finite state recogniser does the same thing as a regular grammar and consists of a set of states, a start / end state and a set of arc labelled with a symbol from the input alphabet
- There are non-deterministic, finding a deterministic FSR requires eliminating choice 
-  Non-terminals / states represented as circles

- Start represented as circle with unmarked arrow

- Terminals used to jump between states eg $X\to bX|aZ$

- Halt / final state represented as a square

### Regular grammar example diagrams 
- Example diagram of a [[Finite_state_machines|FSM]] (called finite there are a finite number of states):

- Example that generates multiples of 3 a's and 2 b's
