# Universal Turing machines
- Runs any problem as a separate Turing machine as if it were a program, this avoids the need for creating a separate TM for each problem
- This makes a UTM the counterpart of a computer but is of course much more powerful
- Takes in a coded version of a TM and its input string, producing the same output as a standard TM, the difference in process can be seen here:

â€¢ We can represent any Turing machine as a set of quintuples (groups of 5 things) 
	1. Current state
	2. Symbol being read 
	3. Symbol to write 
	4. Move (L or R) 
	5. New State
