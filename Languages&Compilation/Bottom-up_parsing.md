# Bottom-up parsing
- Reduces a [[Formal_languages#Sentence|sentence]] to the sentence symbol by applying productions of the grammar
- Done via a **parse stack**, each symbol read is immediately placed on the top of the stack 

## Parse stack operations 
- **Shift**: symbol is read and pushed to stack 
- **Reduce**: top `n` elements are replaced by a non-terminal of the grammar

## Bottom-up parsing process

- The following example grammar will be used: 
$$(1)\ S \to \text{real}\ \text{IDLIST}$$
$$(2) \ \text{IDLIST} \to \text{IDLIST}, \text{ID}$$
$$(3) \ \text{IDLIST} \to \text{ID}$$
$$(4) \ \text{ID} \to A|B|C|D$$

- The sentence `real A,B,C` will be processed, the `‚óè` token indicates where the stack pointer is

1.   Iterate through the symbols in a sentence sequentially, reducing it as much as allowed, in this case `A` is reduced to `IDLIST` and `,` cannot be reduced further :

2. Multiple tokens together can be reduced as well, eg with rule 2 once `B` is reduced to `ID` the following can occur to reduce the stack to `IDLIST`:

3. The tokens `real` and `IDLIST` cannot be merged to become the distinguished symbol `S` unless there are no more tokens to parse, there is more to read so this cannot take place. Once the final symbols `,C` have been processed this can occur:

![[Pasted image 20240316200141.png|250|250]]

4. The parse stops in two scenarios:  when the distinguished symbol `S` is reached or when there are no more reductions left to do after finished reading (input is invalid)

### Bottom-up parsing limitations
-  While the parser should ideally be deterministic, it can be left ambiguous weather SHIFT or REDUCE are to be used (shown in step 3) in this case a lookahead is needed to recognise that there are more symbols to parse without halting by reducing to `S`
- Dealing with the limitations of bottom up parsing may also require altering the grammar
