# Distance vector routing
- A type of [[Routing_protocols|routing protocol]] used in [[Network_architecture|networks]] to determine the best path for forwarding packets of data from one network node to another 
- Typically updates every 30 seconds, due to exchange between neighbours, convergence time varies
- Initialisation step:

## Distance vector pitfalls
-  DV router can advertise incorrect path cost (black-holing)
- Each routerâ€™s table used by others: errors propagate through network
## Routing information protocol algorithm (RIP)
- Uses the [[Bellman_Fords_shortest_path#Bellman Ford's algorithm|Bellman Ford's algorithm]]  to calculate the best path for forwarding packets. 
- This is because the Bellman-Ford algorithm is a decentralised algorithm, which means it can be easily implemented on individual nodes without requiring global knowledge of the [[Network_topology#Network topology|Network topology]]
