# Practical Byzantine fault tolerance
- PBFT is designed to handle [[Byzantine_generals_problem|Byzantine]] faults within distributed systems, ensuring that all non-faulty nodes agree on their states even if some nodes exhibit arbitrary failures.
- This requires both $3f +1$ nodes and a 2-phase communication protocol (eg [[Paxos]], used to carry out any operation that hasn't been reflected in all replicas). 
## PBFT clients
- Uses a primary-backup scheme for replicas, this means clients send requests to primary. It's only if this times out that the client broadcasts a message to all replicas.
- If this broadcast occurs, $f+1$ identical replies are expected. Replicas must carry out the PBFT protocol to ensure the replies from honest nodes are correct

## Ordering requests
- Group initially runs with the primary handling message ordering. The backups must ensure that the primary is behaving correctly as this too is vulnerable to Byzantine failure 
- A view represents a specific configuration in which one of the replicas is designated as the primary. Backups must trigger view change requests if the primary is faulty

## PBFT quorum
- Unlike crash failures where each node votes on one operation at a time, it's not sufficient for quorum's to just intersect. Nodes may vote for multiple operations if malicious 
- This requires the intersection between 2 quorums to have at least 1 honest node. Leading to a min total of $3f+1$ nodes being present overall (super majority rule)

## PBFT process
1. **Client request handling:** clients sends requests to primary. Multicasts if primary isn't responsive
2. **Pre-prepare phase:** primary assigns a seq number to each request (determining order of request execution). This also contains the primary's signature to verify identity prior to multicast

3. **Prepare phase:** upon receiving the pre-prepare message, replicas enter the prepare phase and multicast a prepare message to other replicas.
4. **Prepare message accumulation**: replicas collect prepare messages, and upon achieving a "prepare quorum" ($2f+1$ messages), they enter the commit phase.

5. **Commit phase**: each replica shares what it heard in the prepare phase, multicasting proof that it has accumulated $2f+1$ prepare messages. Each message is signed using a priv key
2. **Execution and reply:** once a commit quorum is achieved, replicas execute the request and send a reply to the client with an agreed on sequence number

## Failure scenarios 
- **Safety attack**: primary sends different messages with same seq number to different replicas, this is protected from by the $2f+1$ quorum requirement
- **Liveness attack**: primary does not forward client requests 

### Byzantine Faults Considered
- **Arbitrary Behavior:** Replicas can behave in any manner, including acting maliciously or erratically.
- **Failure Types:** Includes software errors and malicious attacks, where a node might not stop but continues to perform malicious activities.

### PBFT Client Interaction
- **Direct Interaction:** Clients can interact directly with any replica, typically sending requests to the primary.
- **Response Validation:** Clients wait for ùëì+1f+1 matching replies to validate the response, ensuring responses are from non-faulty replicas.

### Quorum Requirements
- **Intersection:** Requires that the intersection of any two quorums have at least ùëì+1 correct replicas to ensure a valid consensus.
- **Size of Quorum:** Each quorum must have at least 2ùëì+1 replicas to ensure that it includes a majority of correct replicas.

### Security Features
- **Message Authentication:** All messages (client requests and replica messages) are signed to prevent spoofing and replay attacks.
- **View Changes:** Handles primary failures by enabling a new primary election through a view change process.
### Challenges and Limitations
- **Scalability:** The communication overhead and large message sizes can lead to high latency, particularly as the number of replicas increases.
- **Performance:** PBFT's performance can degrade significantly with an increase in the number of faulty nodes.

### Practical Applications
PBFT is used in environments where the integrity and availability of a system are crucial, despite the presence of potential Byzantine failures.
