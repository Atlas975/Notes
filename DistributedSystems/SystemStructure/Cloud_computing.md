# Cloud computing

- Provides on-demand leasing of computing resources, allowing users to obtain and configure [[Virtualisation|virtual]] servers and other services with minimal service provider interactions 
- Highly scalable, on-demand resources can quickly provisioned and released.

## Service types
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** offers software applications over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** a platform allowing users to develop, run, and manage applications.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** provides computing resources eg virtualised physical hardware.

## Fog Computing

- An extension of cloud computing that brings computation, storage, and application services closer to the edge of the network. Ideal for reducing latency (eg with real time applications)
- This increases system responsiveness and improve operational efficiency. Typically handled by having compute geographically closer to clients
