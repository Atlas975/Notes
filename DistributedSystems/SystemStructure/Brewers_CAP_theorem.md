# Brewers CAP theorem
- Fundamental requirements for all [[Distributed_system_design|distributed systems designs]]
	- **Consistency**: system has same state everywhere
	- **Availability**: system operates if one node is responsive 
	- **Partition tolerance**: system operates despite network interruptions
- These cannot all be met at the same time, there must be compromise 
- This becomes more obvious as an application grows as need for scalability, need for high availability along with the network being unreliable are all true at once

## CAP compromise 
- In a distributed system, partition is inevitable so consistency / availability must be given up for the sake of scaling. Eventual consistency is a common compromise 
- This can be partially avoided via the [[Proxy_pattern|proxy pattern]] which is able to mask out the access protocol introducing distribution transparency
