[[Boolean_logic]][[Predicate_logic]][[Propositional_logic]]
- A set of transformations used to convert the intersection / union of a set [[Sets]] into its complement
- Multiple use cases in boolean algebra, also essential in simplifying logic circuits
## De-Morgan's theorem
>$$(\overline{A+B})=\overline{A}\overline{B}$$
>$$\begin{align*}\\
\text{The complement of a sum is equal to the product of a complement }
\end{align*}$$
>$$\overline{(AB)}=\overline{A}+\overline{B}$$
>$$\text{The complement of a product is equal to the sum of complement }$$

## De Morgan's quantifier law
- Law can be applied in predicate logic to find complement expression
