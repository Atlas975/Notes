# Usability
- Focused on human centered design, makes sure products are easy to learn, use and are enjoyable for the user. Often a valuable selling point.
- Other required factors
	1. Being effective to use
	2. Being efficient to use allowing for fast task completion
	3. Being safe to use, easy to recover from errors and safety
	4. Utility, is the product helpful
	5. Learnability, is the product easy to learn
	6. Memorability, easy to remember how to use the product
	7. Satisfaction, is the product pleasurable to use

# Usability evaluating
## Analytic approach (experts)
- Theory
- Models
- Guidelines
- Heuristics 
## Empirical approach (users)
- observations
- surveys
# Evaluating usability
- Methods include
	1. Laboratory tests with controlled settings to evaluate tasks
	2. Measurement, evaluating metrics like time to complete a task
	3. Field studies, focus on user experience through observation
	4. Questionnaires, able to measure the required factors such as satisfaction and utility

# Usability models
## Nielson's model

## Heuristic's model

# Dark patterns
- Dark patterns are constructed understanding of human psychology not accounting for user interest
- Many dark patterns are banned
![[Pasted image 20220208101545.png|450|450]]
- Usually based on three patterns that result in a negative experience
- Game examples include: pay to skip, content delivered only through purchase, pay 2 win 

## Temporal dark patterns

# Roach motel
- Easy for user to enter, hard for the user to get out eg.
![[Pasted image 20220208101646.png|450|450]]
- Other examples include entering credit card details.

# Bait and switch
- User set out to do one thing but something different usually undesirable happens instead.

# Privacy Zuckering
- Act of creating deliberatly confusing interfaces to extract information from users they dont really intend to share. Named after the Facebook CEO himself

# Factors to consider with users
![[Pasted image 20220118090558.png|450|450]]
- Some factors are constant, ability to cope with cognitive load, willingness to cope with stress and available time to concentrate on a problem
- Abilities between users can also vary
1. Cognitive abilities
2. Time one is willing to spend on problems
- Age can also effect individual abilities

# User requirements
- Requirements are something a product must do or a quality it should have
- They are a list of system specifications, specific, measurable and clear
- Requirements can emerge during development
- Requirements should be complete and consistent
- Prototyping is often required to clarify requirements, different users have different priorities 
- It's much cheaper to fix issues in the development phase of a project.
## Functional requirements
- What the system **must do** and how it'll be implemented
## Non-functional requirements
![[Pasted image 20220118092806.png|450|450]]
- Qualities that a system must have, aesthetics, performance, legal restrictions, environmental, usability goals etc.
- These can sometimes be more critical than functional requirements
- Types of non-functional requirements
1. Product requirements: specify how the system should behave in a particular way, execution speed, reliability.
2. Organizational requirements: exist because of organizational policies,  standards used, implementation etc.
3. External requirements: factors that arise from factors external to the system such as legislative requirements
## Requirement engineering process
1. Requirement gathering
2. Requirement analysis and negotiation
3. Requirement documentation
4. Requirement validation

# Lessons from user

## Cultural probes
- Investigating users to gather users, involves the idea that users are experts in their own lives

## Methods of gathering data
- Observation, Questionnaires, Interviews, Workshops
- Think aloud is also another method, where the user describes the process they went through.
- Scenarios, these describe users interaction with the system
