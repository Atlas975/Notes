- Multi-store model:

- Working memory stores memory for a brief period while performing mental operations
- This is also influenced by attention, working memory is brought to the foreground be perception or thought
- Working memory structure

- Central executive coordinates action and decisions
- Phonological loop processes speech, language and sound
- Visuo-spatial processes visual and spatial information
- Episodic buffer processes experiences 

## Working memory limitations
- Limited space, eg doing mental math with large numbers requires intermediate results
- Chunking helps with this eg FMLWTFBRB memorized as chunks FML WTF BRB
- Working memory is volatile and only available for brief periods, distraction can also harm this.
- This should be accounted for when having design choices like too many options, complex actions and forms that require prior information 

## Long term memory structure 

![[Pasted image 20221105152826.png|450|450]]

- Retrieval based on mental cues, forming associates enforced by reiteration or experience

## Semantic memory structure
- Helps associate common items, leading to easier mental cues

## Spatial memory 
- Based on approximate locations ie predicting where a button normally goes
- Note that this is still fuzzy
- Routine tasks may be influenced by perception biased expectation

# Attention
- Attention is what allocates cognitive resources to activities and tasks
- Similar to [[Operating_system_design]]
- These can be done in parallel or in the background

## Focused attention 
- Similar to a spotlight, can be quickly moved but is always focused on a small part of the world
- Size of spotlight influenced by working memory

## Attention control 
- Selective attention describes the ability to focus on a stimulus while ignoring everything else
- Acts as a filter for sensory data
- Information may also not be filtered out but simply have its volume turned down 
- This can be based on meaning and linguistic content, see cocktail part effect
- **Top-down attention**: based on goals, expectations and internal cues
- **Bottom-up attention:** driven by stimuli and external word cues

## Multitasking
- Limited cognitive resources to attend multiple tasks at the same time
- Tasks that require separate resources can be done this way
- Otherwise requires alternating attention
- Unintentional blindness is an example of this, we may be unaware of something simply due to a lack of focus 
- Tunnel vision, the tendency to focus on one area is also an example of this
- Change blindness is common in UI, an element may be added that the user is unaware of
