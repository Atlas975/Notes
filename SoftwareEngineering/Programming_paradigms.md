# Imperative programming 
- Simple to implement and can contain loops and variables 
- Unable to solve complex problems, less efficient and parallel programming is not possible 
- Closely follows machine like assembly instructions and follows  [[Computer_architecture#Von Neumman architecture|Von Neumman architecture]]

## Procedural programming 
- Identical in approach to imperative 
- Able to reuse groups of code procedures through the use of functions 

## Object oriented programming 
[[OOP_principles]]
- More emphasis on data rather than procedures 
- Processing is primarily handled through objects

# Declarative programming 
- Define what the desired outcome is not how its done
- Divided into logic, functional and database.
- Programs are designed in a way where computation logic is expressed independently of its control flow
## Functional programming
