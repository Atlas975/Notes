#OperatingSystems 
# Malware
- Short for malicious software
- Examples include Trojan, virus, worm, zombie and ransomware
- Exploitation in an information system is typically done through the weakest link such as an operating system defect. Programmers need to be aware of these vulnerabilities
- Examples include data leakage, unsecured wifi, network spoofing, improper session handling etc.

## Trojan
- Malicious software masquerading as something else that you actually want
- Normally used to steal information

## Virus
- Embedded software that can copy itself to other programs and spread
- Resident virus: copy onto memory and run in the background
- Non-resident virus: find host to infect then spread 

## Worm
- Program that copies itself across a network
- Doesn't need to actually infect programs, usually spread through email

## Zombie
- Once infected by a virus/trojan, multiplies by using the infected machine to multiply
- Can also flood server with requests in whats known as a DDOS attack

## Ransomware
- Program that enters a computer and encrypts user data until they pay ransom to receive an encryption key, hard to reverse without encryption key being known
- Uses cryptography to block access to files and data

# Malware access
- One way is using a disk where auto-run is enabled
- Using a bad link in an email
- Exploiting OS weaknesses
- Effects can turn off computer auto-restore, block anti-virus scan and generate a large amount of traffic

# Malevolent online practices
- Malware isn't the only exploitative practice out there
- Othere examples include

## Phishing
- Performed using spam communication containing a sometimes convincing hyperlink
- Accessing these also reveals that the users email is valid which can lead to more spam

## Social engineering
- Based on trust, using personal info to build trust in the attacker eg the nigerian prince scam
- Also known as grooming, a long process to earn the users trust

## Online stalking
- Obsessively watching a person, often leads to doxxing in which personal information is made publicly available
## Abuse
- The use of deepfakes, a highly convincing way to imitate another persons image either to build trust or damage reputations 

## Manipulation
- Examples include fake news and propaganda to spread false information
