- Algorithms describe an effective method of solving a problem
- It must except an input, terminate and produce the correct solution
- Examples: Websearch (input text output websites), google maps(input destination output path)

# Algorithm fundamentals
- Two main resources

1. Space: memory required to solve a problem
2. Time: steps (relative to input size) taken to solve problem

- These describe performance. Correctness, robustness and simplicity are also important
- Space complexity: amount of memory needed for an algorithm to run to completion.

## Fixed part 
- Data size that's independent of the use case and input in a program

## Variable path 
- Space needed by variables whose size depend on the size of the problem

## Algorithm performance analysis
- This can be theoretical or describe the actual run time on computers.
- Runtime depends on numerous factors including:

1. Size of input
2. Organization of input
3. No of processor cores
4. Optimal operating temperature

- Runtime is usually measured with its upper bound (worst case)
- Space complexity is usually not considered as most modern devices have enough memory, time complexity is still important
