# Floyd Warshall's shortest path
- Finds the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a [[Graphs|graph]], works with negative edges but is not able to work with negative cycles 
- The goal of the algorithm is to eventually consider going through all possible intermediate nodes on paths of differing lengths

## Floyd Warshall's algorithm

```python
def floyd_warshall(graph) -> dict: # O(V^3) time, O(V^2) space
    dist = {u: {v: float('inf') for v in graph} for u in graph}

    for u in graph:
        for v, weight in graph[u].items():
            dist[u][v] = weight
        dist[u][u] = 0

    for k, i, j in product(graph.keys(), repeat=3):
        if dist[i][j] > (weight := dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]):
            dist[i][j] = weight
    return dist
```
