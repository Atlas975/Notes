Based on the provided details, I would recommend organizing the database as follows:

1.  Create a table called "Players" with the following columns:
    
    -   Player_ID (primary key)
    -   Forename
    -   Surname
    -   Email_Address
    -   Subscription_Start_Date
    -   Subscription_End_Date
2.  Create a table called "Characters" with the following columns:
    
    -   Character_ID (primary key)
    -   Player_ID (foreign key to the "Players" table)
    -   Character_Creation_Date
    -   Character_Expiry_Date
    -   Character_Name
    -   Character_Type
    -   Level
    -   Experience_Points
    -   Max_Health
    -   Health
    -   Attack_Score
    -   Defence_Score
    -   Stealth_Score
    -   Mana_Score
    -   Money_Bank
    -   Money_Wallet
3.  Create a table called "Items" with the following columns:
    
    -   Item_ID (primary key)
    -   Item
    -   Item_Type
    -   Weapon_Type
    -   Range
    -   Price
    -   Quantity
    -   Defend_Score
    -   Attack_Score
    -   Healing_Score
    -   Mana_Score
    -   Single_Use
    -   Wearable
    -   Worn
4.  Create a table called "Armor" with the following columns:
    
    -   Armor_ID (primary key)
    -   Item_ID (foreign key to the "Items" table)
    -   Body_Part
5.  Create a table called "Inventories" with the following columns:
    
    -   Inventory_ID (primary key)
    -   Character_ID (foreign key to the "Characters" table)
    -   Item_ID (foreign key to either the "Items" table or the "Armor" table, depending on the item type)
    -   Quantity
6.  Create a table called "Combat" with the following columns:
    
    -   Combat_ID (primary key)
    -   Battle_Date
    -   Battle_No
    -   Attacker (foreign key to the "Characters" table)
    -   Defender (foreign key to the "Characters" table)
    -   Weapon (foreign key to the "Items" table)
    -   Result
    -   Damage
7.  Create a table called "Billing" with the following columns:
    
    -   Billing_ID (primary key)
    -   Player_ID (foreign key to the "Players" table)
    -   Character_ID (foreign key to the "Characters" table)
    -   Billing_Date
    -   Amount

This database design allows for the creation and management of player accounts, characters, inventories, combat information, and billing information. It also separates armor items from other items in the database, which makes it easier to manage and query the data.
