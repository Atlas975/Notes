# SQL patterns
## SQL where filtering 

â€“mcncenn
```
We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:  
- First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.  
- Identifies their gender as 'F'  
- Born in February, May, or December  
- Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg  
- Their patient_id is an odd number  
- They are from the city 'Kingston'
```

```sql
SELECT *
from patients
WHERE
  first_name LIKE '__r%'
  AND gender = 'F'
  AND month(birth_date) IN (2, 5, 12)
  AND weight between 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';
```
