# Consumption bundle
- Complete list of quantities available of all goods.
- Example: 
> A = (2, 5, 1) or A = (2 bananas, 5 coconuts, 1 fish)

# Preferences 
- The order of preference for consumers can vary:

## Assumptions
>![[Pasted image 20211101100704.png|500|500]]

# Utility function
- Assigns a index number of happiness allowing us to help rank consumption bundles with no clear advantage over another.
- U function X consumption bundle (U(X))
- This is a ranking system (more=better), not a quantifier of happiness in a consumption bundle (ordinal utility)
# Indifference curves
>![[Pasted image 20211101101820.png]]
- For instance (1,12),(2,6) all have the same level of preference
- The curve shows all the consumption bundles where the consumer is indifferent to consumption model combinations. (in this case where utility=12)
- Indifference curves cannot cross as each curve must have a unique utility level 
- Marginal rate of return can change as when a person gets more of one thing, the thing they have a few of is more valuable.
## Multiple indifference curves
> ![[Pasted image 20211101102421.png|500|500]]
- Higher utility goes higher as the consumer strictly prefers it.
- Indifference curves always downward slope

# Marginal utility
- The utility increase from one additional good.
## Diminishing marginal utility
- Typically more of one thing, the additional utility begins to decline.
## Marginal rate of substitution
- Trade-offs: keeping utility constant , looks into how much of one good a consumer will give up for more of another good.
- Example:
>![[Pasted image 20211101104154.png]]
- Marginal rate of return can change as when a person gets more of one thing, the thing they have a few of is more valuable.
- Given a question like this:
>![[Pasted image 20220125183021.png]]
- The answer can be found by taking the derivative of x1 and x2, and dividing them by each while plugging in the points. Answer is 2
# Budget constraints 
- Budget is defined by m
- Consumption bundles are only feasible if expenditure doesen't exceed budget (
## Budget sets
- All bundles satisfying budget constraints 
## Budget line
- All bundles exceeding budget constraints

# Asymmetric information
- One side of transaction has more information than another
- Types of information
>![[Pasted image 20220117103548.png]]

# Asymmetric information in imperfect competitive markets
- Influenced by price discrimination
- Symmetric + no price discrimination example

- Self-selection solution, this automatically reveals hidden characteristics about the consumer

# Asymmetric information in competitive markets

- Asymmetric information example, high ability workers are harmed

# Adverse selection
>![[Pasted image 20220118122334.png]]
- Example
>![[Pasted image 20220118122419.png]]
- The buyer assumes the car is in excellent condition
- Example 2, calculating reservation price
>![[Pasted image 20220118122716.png]]
- This puts incentive for low quality goods
# Moral hazard
- People take fewer precautions when they know they're insured
>![[Pasted image 20220118123640.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220118123832.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220118123852.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220118123907.png]]
## Co-insurance
- Helps prevent moral hazard by placing some of the cost on the consumer eg 20%
>![[Pasted image 20220118124300.png]]
- Another method is excess, where insurance is only guaranteed when a certain level of loss occurs. 


# Labour markets
>![[Pasted image 20211216154225.png]]
- Considerations:
## Labour supply: 
- how workers decide on how much they work. This can be dotted on a graph
>![[Pasted image 20211216154725.png]]
*168 represents the amount of time working*
- Slope determined by wage

## Substitution & income effect
Example 1:
>![[Pasted image 20211216154953.png]]
- Substitution effect is positively correlated by wage change
- Income effect is negatively correlated by wage change
Example 2:
>![[Pasted image 20211216155159.png]]
- Substitution and income effect are positively correlated by wage change
Summary:
- A persons substitution and income effect can vary, increased income might make people want to work more or less depending on how much they need the pay.
## Labour demand
- how much labour firms demand and how this tranfers across the industry
- Example graph:
>![[Pasted image 20211216155446.png]]
- Overtime introduces a kink in the graph with higher pay
>![[Pasted image 20211216155600.png]]
- Income tax effect: eg people wont want part time jobs
>![[Pasted image 20211216155638.png]]
- The benefit of each worker actually varies and can be represented by:
>![[Pasted image 20211216155933.png]]
- The wage is still a horizontal line (Marginal cost of labour)
- Decrease in wage:
>![[Pasted image 20211216160309.png]]
- Table representation:
>![[Pasted image 20211216205630.png]]
- In the following example it's ideal to stop at 5 workers

# Minimum wage
- In standard models, minimum wages can generate excess labour supply (enemployment). However in a monopsony it can raise employment
## Difference in earnings
- Difference in pay reflects diffierent value in human capital. 
- Human capital explanation: pay proportional to their human capital (combination of education,energy, experience etc)
## Trade unions
- Two workers producing same output may earn differently due to one belonging to a union.
>![[Pasted image 20211216224956.png]]
- Pay difference can also be due to customer discrimination, employer discrimination or winner takes all situations

# Measuring income inequality

## Gini coefficient 
>![[Pasted image 20211216225408.png]]


# Labor demand
- Labor demand is influenced by supply and demand analysis, which in tun is influenced by worker productivity and the price of worker output
- Diminishing returns to labor assumes that non-labor input is kept constant.
>![[Pasted image 20220228102141.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220228103128.png]]
productivity increases also shift the curve right

# Value of marginal product (VMP)
- Extra revenue from adding a worker, demand for labor can shift based on:

# Labor supply

## Factors that shift labor supply
>![[Pasted image 20220228104415.png]]
## Reservation wage
- Lowest wage a worker will accept for a job, opportunity cost of working is leisure activity. Work compensates for this, cost-benefit principle

## Real wage / employment equilibrium

# Effects of inequality

# Optimal bundle
> ![[Pasted image 20211102123833.png]]
- C is optimal as it falls within the budget and optimizes utility
- Slope of indifference curve gives marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
- Optimal consumption occurs when the amount of x1 is equal to the ratio of x1/x2
> ![[Pasted image 20211108101233.png]]
#### The cost and benefit ratio need to be the same
- For a normal good, an income increase results in more consumption
- For an inferior good, an income increase results in less consumption.
