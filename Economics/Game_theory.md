#Economics 
# Game theory
- The study of strategic situations, there are two types
- Games are mathematical models used to study strategic interaction between rational decision makers. 
## Non strategic situations
- Decisions that aren't effected by other peoples decisions & situation.
- Examples: 
1. perfect competition, they don't have to worry about competitors prices. The price is already given.
2. Monopoly, no competition that needs to be considered.
## Strategic situation
- Other players exist and a players decision is influenced by these other players.
# Game models
## Sequentially played games
- moves are made one after another, players can see what moves have been taken prior to making their move
## Normal form game
- Three elements:
1. Players
2. Strategies
3. Payoffs / Utilities (outcomes)

# Stable outcomes
- An outcome is stable if there is no incentive to move from an outcome.
# Dominance
- A method of solving a game
- This is done by taking each players perspective.
- Strict dominance Example:
>![[Pasted image 20211130124411.png]]
- In this case, player2 to has no reason to cooperate 5,2 > 4,1
- player1 has no reason to defect as 5,2 >4,1
## Nash equilibrium 
- Also known as a stable outcome
- This results in a Nash equilibrium
>![[Pasted image 20211130124757.png]]
- This is known as a prisoners dilemma, both players cooperating would be best overall but both players being rational results in both of them defecting


# Iterated dominance
- Method of deriving Nash equilibrium by removing columns that are inertly worse

- Example of two Nash equilibrium

# Infinitely repeated games

- Strategies:

## Matching pennies 
- Games with no Nash equilibrium
## One shot games
- An interaction happens just one
## Repeated games
- An interaction happens many times
## Social planners
- Will always pick best combined payoff

## Cournot model
- Market where firms choose output levels
- If its given how much another firm will output, this model will know how to maximize profits.
### Reaction function
- The best response of a player given another players output
>![[Pasted image 20211209154649.png]]
- The function tells us the best output quantity in response to player 2s output
- Function with both

## Algebraic Nash equilibrium 
- Examples:

## Bertrand model 
- A market where firms decide on price	
- Consumers will flock to whatever firm has the lowest price in this model.
- This is not the case in real life where consumers can distinguish between products

## Monopolistic competition
- In this condition, consumers CAN differentiate between competing products.

## Sources of market power

# Market structures
>![[Pasted image 20211209162704.png]]

# Perfect competition
## Assumptions
- Market has many buyers and sellers
- Firms produce identical outputs so no individual firm can control price.
- No barriers to enter or exit market.
- This means consumers can easily switch products if prices increase

## Profit maximization
> Marginal revenue = Marginal cost

## Revenues

#### Note marginal is always the derivative 
## Graphically

# Perfect competition profit
> Profit = Marginal Cost

# Monopoly characteristics
- Monopoly have small consumer surplus but large producer surplus. Otherwise there is no producer surplus

## Price discrimination 
- There are multiple types of price discrimination

# Oligopoly
- A market with many buyers but few sellers
## Cartel
- A group of market participants who collude to improve profits and dominate the market, often illegal
- Proof of cartel instability

- When accounting for actions, a normal form table doesen't account for the order of decisions, this can be accounted for by a tree
