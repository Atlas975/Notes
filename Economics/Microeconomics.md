# Elasticity definition
- measures how sensitive consumers are to price change. 
- An elasticity of 2/3 would mean a 1% increase in price leads to a 2/3% decrease in demand

## Luxury good 
- if elasticity is greater than 1 the good can be known as a luxury good. 
# Elasticity determinants
- Availability of substitutes
- For example, a required textbook will be relatively inelastic in demand.
- Time to adjust
- Addiction
# Point price elasticity
- Elasticity between two points is known as arc elasticity
- Point price elasticity gives elasticity at specific point: 
- delta q over delta p is also known as the slope.

# Cross-price elasticity
- Percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a 1% price change of another good. 
- Example: 
>if the price of coffee increases by 1% and demand for tea increases by 2% then the cross price elasticity of demand for tea with respect to coffee prices is 2.
# Income elasticity of demand
- Change in quantity demanded after a 1% change in consumer income.
# Price elasticity of demand
- Sellers sensitivity to price change

# Optimal bundle
![[Pasted image 20211102123833.png|450|450]]
- C is optimal as it falls within the budget and optimizes utility
- Slope of indifference curve gives marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
- Optimal consumption occurs when the amount of x1 is equal to the ratio of x1/x2

#### The cost and benefit ratio need to be the same
- For a normal good, an income increase results in more consumption
- For an inferior good, an income increase results in less consumption.
