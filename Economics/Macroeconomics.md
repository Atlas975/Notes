# Types of unemployment
## Structural unemployment
- Long term unemployment that exists even when the economy is stable
- Can be due to a lack of skills, discrimination or language barriers. The skill gap is a large contributor. 
- Long term unemployment costs a lot to society with loss of worker income and countries outcome

## Frictional unemployment
- Short term unemployment as workers are matched with jobs
## Cyclical unemployment
- The unemployment that takes place during a recession, caused by a decline in demand.

# Costs of unemployment
## Economic
- Lost wages / production
- Decreased taxes
## Psychological 
- Individual self-esteem loss and family stress, increased uncertainty
## Social
- Potential increase in crimes and social issues
# Duration of unemployment effects
![[Pasted image 20220208131836.png|450|450]]
- 6 months or more is considered long term unemployment 
- Short term has several potential outcomes
	1. Find a permanent job after a few weeks
	2. Leave labor force 
	3. Short term employment that leads to unemployment again, similar costs to long term unemployment
# Other unemployment issues
- Workers can become discouraged and stop looking for a job
- Part time workers count as full-time but can't find a real job, these are counted as employed

# Unemployment causes
- Setting a minimum wage higher than that of the equilibrium point of real wage/employment leads to unemployment. This unemployment is structural and continues to exist over time.
- Health and safety regulations can reduce the demand for labor by increasing employment costs and reducing productivity
- Any other forced control / welfare can lead to losses to firms, resulting in more unemployment.
