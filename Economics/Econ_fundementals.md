# Principles
## Scarcity principle
- Having more of one thing means less of something else
- More of one thing means less of other thing 
## Cost-Benefit principle
- A rational person only makes decisions if benefits outweigh cost
# Types of cost
## Opportunity 
The value of the next best alternative that's lost by taking an action.
**Only includes next best, if you're already committed to a certain option, its previous alternative is lost**
## Sunk cost
Non recoverable when decision is made.
*example: finishing something you don't like the taste of because you already bought it*
Also known as sunk cost fallacy
### Decision pitfalls
Measuring cost/benefit as proportions

>  Marginal cost (Deriv Total cost)
> Marginal vs Average (econ of scale)

# Profit maximization
- The gap is the profit

# Assets vs liabilities
-**Assets are the items you own that can provide future economic benefit.** **Liabilities are what you owe other parties**. In short, assets put money in your pocket, and liabilities take money out
