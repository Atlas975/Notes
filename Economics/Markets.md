# Demand curve
![[Pasted image 20211029112457.png|450|450]]

- Shows the relationship between how much people want to buy and the price of the good, in theory quantity demanded and price are inversely proportional 

#### An upward sloping demand curve is known as a Giffen good

## Demand curve effects

# Supply curve
![[Pasted image 20211029113316.png|450|450]]
- Shows the relationship between how much suppliers wish to sell and the products actual price. In theory supplier wish to sell more when there's more demand and vise versa.
## Supply curve upward causation 
![[Pasted image 20211029114010.png|450|450]]

# Market equilibrium 
- Where supply and demand curves intersect.
![[Pasted image 20211029114106.png|450|450]]
## Market properties 
### Excess demand
![[Pasted image 20211029115328.png|450|450]]
- People want to buy but cant due to high demand. Market is out of equilibrium as there's an upward pressure on prices
### Excess supply
![[Pasted image 20211029115431.png|450|450]]
- Sellers want to sell but cant due to low expected prices, market is out of equilibrium with downward pressure on prices 
## Price ceiling and floor 
![[Pasted image 20211029115905.png|450|450]]
- The government putting a price ceiling can cause an excess is supply
- The government putting a price floor can cause an excess in demand 

# Market behavior 
## Change in demand/supply
![[Pasted image 20211029121807.png|450|450]]
## Factors that shift demand
> 1. ![[Pasted image 20211029121906.png|450|450]]
> 2. ![[Pasted image 20211029122842.png|450|450]]
> 3. ![[Pasted image 20211029122921.png|450|450]]
## Compliment good
- A product that positively effects the demand of another product *eg: burgers and fries*
- A decrease in compliment good price results in an increase in demand and vise versa.
### Increase in demand
![[Pasted image 20211029123542.png|450|450]]
## Substitute good
- A product that negatively effects the demand curve of another product *eg: burgers and pizza*
- A decrease in subsitute good price results in a decrease in demand and vise versa.
### Decrease in demand

# Savings and financial markets
>Saving = income-spending on current needs
>Saving rate = saving/income
>Wealth = assets-liabilities

## Balance sheet
- A list of economic assets and liabilities including specific dates and in a specific unit
- Example:
![[Pasted image 20220307101214.png|450|450]]
- A flow is defined per unit of time including income, spending, saving and wage 
- A stock is defined at a point in time
- A flow of savings cause stock of wealth to change, high savings rate contributes to living standard.
- Capital gains increases the value of existing assets (higher stock value)
- Capital losses decrease the value of existing assets

## Reasons for savings
![[Pasted image 20220307102255.png|450|450]]
- Life-cycle savings
![[Pasted image 20220307102539.png|450|450]]

## National savings formula
![[Pasted image 20220307104135.png|450|450]]

## Spending on current needs formula
![[Pasted image 20220307104332.png|450|450]]

## Private savings formula
![[Pasted image 20220307104725.png|450|450]]

## Public savings formula

# Financial markets
![[Pasted image 20220308124630.png|450|450]]
- Higher interest rates lead to more savers than borrowers

## Technology improvement
![[Pasted image 20220309101541.png|450|450]]

## Government budget savings

# Short-term economic fluctuations
- Business cycles are short-term fluctuations in GDP
- Recessions are when growth is significantly lower rate than normal (a period of two or more consecutive quarters)
- A depression is a particularly severe recession
![[Pasted image 20220322120907.png|450|450]]
- A peak is the beginning of a recession
- A trough is end of a recession

## Output gap
![[Pasted image 20220322124414.png|450|450]]

## Natural rate of unemployment

# Choice under uncertainty
## Expected value
![[Pasted image 20220117101042.png|450|450]]
- Expected value cost of 0 example:
![[Pasted image 20220117101326.png|450|450]]
- This implies that playing an infinite amount of times results in no change from initial condition.
## Individual risk types

# Externalities
![[Pasted image 20220124112910.png|450|450]]
![[Pasted image 20220124125242.png|450|450]]
![[Pasted image 20220124125310.png|450|450]]
![[Pasted image 20220124125641.png|450|450]]
## Negative externality
- Costs that fall on people other than who peruse the activity
## Positive externality
- Benefit received from people other than those who persue it

# Coarse theorem 
- Asks if people can arrive at efficient solutions caused by externalities through bargaining.
![[Pasted image 20220124125926.png|450|450]]
- With no communication a filter wont be installed by zoe
![[Pasted image 20220124130012.png|450|450]]
- With communication, payment can be made and everyone can benefit.
- Reverse power example:
![[Pasted image 20220124130237.png|450|450]]
## Limitation of coarse theorem
- Requires costless negotiations which isnt always the case, legal methods can be used to correct this by placing social incentives.


# Consumer surplus 
- Difference between buyers reservation price and whats paid
![[Pasted image 20211029153314.png|450|450]]
5+4+3+2+1

# Producer surplus 
- Difference between sellers reservation price and whats received
![[Pasted image 20211029153549.png|450|450]]
2*4 / 2

# Total economic surplus (total welfare)
- Consumer surplus + producer surplus
- In the previous example, consumer surplus = €2000/day; producer surplus = €4000/day so, 
> Total Surplus= €2000/day + €4000/day = €6000/day

# Pareto efficient 
- No one can be made better without making someone worse. Must be market equilibrium.

## Absolute advantage
![[Pasted image 20220119100502.png|450|450]]
- Production possibilities:

![[Pasted image 20220119101552.png|450|450]]
- Calculating opportunity cost
![[Pasted image 20220119102141.png|450|450]]
- Zoe has comparative advantage in producing bread
- Ian has comparative advantage in producing beer
## Autarky

![[Pasted image 20220119103337.png|450|450]]

# Tariffs
- Tax imposed on imports
![[Pasted image 20220119104051.png|450|450]]
![[Pasted image 20220119104501.png|450|450]]
![[Pasted image 20220119104848.png|450|450]]
- Reduces overall surplus
