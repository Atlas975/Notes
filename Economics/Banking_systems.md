# Banking systems
- Bank reserves are cash or similar assets held by banks to meet withdrawal requests and payments, the cash in banks vaults isn't part of money supply
- A 100% reserve banking system means banks hold 100% of their deposits
- Banks in which this is not the case is called a fractional-reserve banking system, this money not kept is typically used for loans, investments etc.
- Interest rates need to fall to incentivize

# Securitization
- A practice in which banks pool existing loans and sell them to other other financial institutes
- This method increases the supply of credit and lending opportunities of a bank, but increases risk as it relies on people paying back debts 

# Central bank
- Conduct monetary policy, oversee and regulate financial markets
- Does not maximise profit, instead promotes public goals such as economic growth and low inflation
- Money supply is controlled indirectly as open market purchases of of government 
>![[Pasted image 20220316104549.png]]
- The central bank can lower the nominal interest rate by increasing money supply

# Money
- Provides a means of comparing the value of different items, money also eliminates the need for bartering	
- Inflation can be seen as the erosion of money value
- There are different definitions for what is and isnt money

# Money demand
- A persons money demand is also known as an individuals liquidity preference. The quantity demanded increases with income
- The cost of holding money is the interest revenue forgone
- The higher the interest rate the lower the amount of money demanded. Money demand depends on

## Fed interest rate control 
>![[Pasted image 20220503190558.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220503191437.png]]

- The federal bank can also allow other banks to borrow reserves at a discounted rate

## Money  supply
>![[Pasted image 20220503191908.png]]
- Feds can influence the money supply by controlling the money held by the public, bank reserves or the desired reserve-deposit ratio

## Monetary policy reaction
>![[Pasted image 20220503193337.png]]
- Expansionary gaps leads to inflation, recessionary gaps lead to recessions, therefore its the central banks to keep growth stable 



# Consumer price index (CPI)
- Measure of cost of living during a specific period, influences policy decisions and wage increases 
- It does this by measuring the cost of a sample of goods relative to the cost of the same basket last year, base year changes periodically.
- Example basket:
>![[Pasted image 20220209100535.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20220209100729.png]]
- CPI measures price changes but not quality changes eg increased computer performance of 20% with a 20% increase in price. 

# CPI downsides
- Fixed basket of goods, does not account for product substitution for when something becomes more expensive.
- CPI accounting for substitution example
>![[Pasted image 20220209180259.png]]
- Incorporating new goods is difficult as there's no base good to comapre to

# Inflation / deflation
>![[Pasted image 20220209101051.png]]
- Example:
>![[Pasted image 20220209101149.png]]
- Inflation can be overstated by:
	1. Unnecessary increases to government spending
	2. Underestimating increase in standard of living
- For instance estimated inflation of 3% when living costs only increase by 2%
- Cost of inflation
> ![[Pasted image 20220209183023.png]]
- **Overall a low and stable inflation rate is ideal for long term investment**
## Inflation can be caused
- Three factors can increase the inflation rate 
1. Output gap 
2. Inflation shock 
3. Shock to potential output

# Adjusting for inflation
- Nominal quantity measures in terms of real dollar value
- Real quantity measures in physical terms (quantity)
- Values over time are compared in nominal quantity
- Example inflation adjusting

## Real wages
- Wage paid to workers measured in purchasing power
- Example:

- Wage trends:
>![[Pasted image 20220209161725.png]]

## Price indexing / labor contracts
- Increases nominal quantity by percentage increase of a specific price index. This prevents nominal quantities purchasing power from being eroded by inflation
- It adjusts values such as social security payments by inflation amount eg a 3% increase in social security costs also increases how much social security recipients receive by 3%.  
- Example:
>![[Pasted image 20220209173502.png]]
- Minimum wage

## Seasonal price increases

# Inflation distortion 
- Governments usually keep inflation low, one reason for this is that inflation can devalue investments people have. This is known as the shoeleather cost where inflation causes a loss in return of investment
- Inflation also interferes with long term planning as it results in less investment for the future. Long term planning becomes risky

# Inflation wealth redistribution
- Inflation benefits firms, increased revenue for products
- Workers typically lose out as prices increase without adjustments to salary to account for inflation. Salaries lose purchasing power.
- The opposite is also true as wage cuts usually arent accepted when deflation occurs and purchasing power increases
- Borrowers also benefit as they then pay with dollars worth less than they originally were

# Menu costs
- Costs of adjusting prices frequently as a result of inflation
- Also includes cost of workers memorizing new prices

# Money value
```
real money value -= inflation
```


# Fixed exchange rates 
- Most large industrial countries use a fixed exchanged rate, these greatly reduce the effect of monetary policy on exchange rate, fixed rates promote international trade
- For a fixed exchange rate to be established, a government,  states the value of its currency relative to another major currency. The government then attempts to maintain it at this fixed level
- In a fixed exchange rate system the following terms arise
- Devaluation: reduction in official value of a currency (in fixed system)
- Revaluation: increase in the official value of a currency (in fixed system)
- Example overvaluation and finding equalibrium

## Response to overvalued currency
- Devalue the currency
- Impose trade barriers
- Purchase the currency
## Maintaining overvalued exchange rates 
- To purchase its own currency and maintain an overvalued exchange rate a country must hold international reserves.
- Balance of payment deficits occurs when a country has a net decline in international reserves over a year 
- Balance of payment surplus occurs when a country has a net increase in international reserves over a year
- Fixed rates force the central bank to choose between defending the currency and stabilizing the economy 

# Flexible exchange rates 
- Flexible exchange rates strengthen the effect of monetary policy
- This can be beneficial for small economies, Argentina was able to fight hyper inflation by valuing its peso on bar with the US dollar, inflation quickly decreased thereafter

 # Flexible vs fixed exchange rates 
 - Fixed provides predictability and stability in foreign transactions as well as some level of certainty for the future of the currencies
 - Fixed rates don't last forever as sudden unforeseen changes are still possible
 - Predicting long term exchange rates is difficult in both scenarios
 - If monetary policy is used to set the fundamental value of an exchange rate equal to the official value, its no longer available for stabilizing the domestic economy, this conflict is most  severe under a speculative attack
## Speculative attacks
- A massive selling of domestic currency assets by financial investors, reducing the demand for a foreign currency and thus its value
- A speculative attack on the peso 

>![[Pasted image 20220603170235.png]]

- Tightening of monetary policy reduces over valuation

### The Euro 
- Countries with a single currency must have a common monetary policy, countries sacrifice some control to be part of the euro which is controlled by the central European bank.
- As economic conditions vary in countries, the central bank cannot respond to each of them
