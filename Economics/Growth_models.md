# Keynesian model 
- The building block for theories on short-run economic fluctuations 
- In the short-run, firms meet demand at present prices, menu costs describe the costs of changing such prices 
- Firms change prices when marginal benefits exceed marginal costs, technology has helped reduce this

# Planned aggregate expenditure
- The total planned spending on final goods and services 
- Components include:
1. Consumption (C) by households
2. Investment (I) the planned spending by firms on capital goods 
3. Government purchases (G) made by federal state and local governments 
4. Net exports (NX) equal exports minus imports 
- Actual planned expenditure is equal to 

>$$PAE = C + i^P + G + NX$$

# Solow growth model
- The growth model can summarized by the function as
> total output (Y) = F (physical labor, capital)
