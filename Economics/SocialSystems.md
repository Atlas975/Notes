## Neoliberalism
![[Pasted image 20220208134742.png|450|450]]
- Focused on:
	1. Free trade
	2. Privatisation
	3. Shrinking the state
	4. Tax cuts
	5. Budget cuts preventing state intervention
- Main downside is that economic inequality rapidly grows

# Common goods
- Private goods: someones use of an item prevents someone else's use of the item (excludable and rivalrous in consumption)
- Common goods tend to be used more than is socially desirable
- Public grazing land example:

- There are two effects here, maginal private utility of adding another cow and the marginal social cost of the risk of overgrazing

# Public goods
- Public goods are non rivalrous and non excludable

- non rivalrous and non excludable encourages people to freeload
