# Producer goal
- Maximize profits minimize costs
- This assumes the firm produces one good
# Production function
![[Pasted image 20211108105046.png]]
# Short run vs long run inputs
- In the short run some inputs are variable such as labor or fixed like capital which CANT be changed in the short run.
- In the long run, all inputs are variable and more flexible
- In the short run capital is fixed.
# Marginal product of labor
>![[Pasted image 20211109120807.png|500|500]]
- This has a diminishing rate of return eg. more people than equipment.
# Long run production decisions
- Trade off between L and K (like the trade off of buying one thing over another)
## Isoquants:

## Cobb-Douglas production function
>![[Pasted image 20211109121351.png]]
- Q = total output
- L = labor output
- K = capital output
#### similar to consumer utility function

- Price ratio is the absolute value of the isocost lines slope.

- In the long run, fixed costs matter less.
