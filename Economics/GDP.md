# GDP
- The market value of all goods and services produced during a period.
- Usually associated with QOL and education standards
- It does not reflect distribution of income and the effect of economic growth on the country itself. 
- Investments within the country not included in GDP, these are classified as savings. 
- Example GDP contribution

*note GDP does not account for work put in*
- Example of work unaccounted for in GDP

## Governments in GDP
- Government investment is also counted in GDP valued at its cost.
- Some of these can't be established
## Final goods and services
- Consumed by ultimate user (consumers) included in GDP
>![[Pasted image 20220202102132.png]]
- Example with intermediate goods
>![[Pasted image 20220202102306.png]]
- GDP does not account for intermediate goods
## Value added
- Value added is market value of a product minus cost of inputs

## Produced over a period of time
>![[Pasted image 20220202102837.png]]
- Unless there are capital gains in interest, the commission and repeated payments aren't counted in GDP

# Nominal vs real GDP
>![[Pasted image 20220207101632.png]]
- Nominal GDP increases don't account in inflation
- In real GDP, if quantity is falling at a slower rate than prices, than real GDP will be higher than nominal GDP.

# GDP limitations
- Leisure activities don't contribute GDP despite being an overall welfare contributor.
- Does not account for pollution and underground economies.
>![[Pasted image 20220207102633.png]]
- GDP does not account for intangibles eg traffic, crime, community
- Also does not account for wealth inequality
- Real GDP is still the best measure of life quality

# GDP price deflator
- Measures changes in prices for all goods and services produced in an economy. Helps identify how much prices have inflated over a period of time. Trends are similar to CPI
- Allows for changes in the basket of goods to be accounted for in inflation. For instance substitution and change in quality of goods 
>![[Pasted image 20220209182420.png]]
- Its also important to distinguish between inflation in one good and overall inflation, to counteract overall inflation the government can use fiscal and monetary polices  

# Zuznets curve
- An inverse relationship between economic growth and inequality
- Inequality increases as investment creates a wealthy class
- Influx of labor keeps wages low.
- Increased education and democracy lowers inequality.

# Output per person formulas
> GDP per person = real GDP (Y) / total population
> ![[Pasted image 20220221100814.png]]
- Output in general can be summarized as the following function
> Output (Y) = Function of (productivity factors)

# Factors that effect labor productivity
>![[Pasted image 20220221100904.png]]

1. Human capital involves talent, education, training and worker skills
- Cost-benefit principle applies
2. Physical capital involves machinery and tools used to enhance productivity
- Diminishing returns on capital increases.
3. Land and resources, include things like farmland and natural resources
4. Technology, includes transportation, medicine, communications and other QOL
5. Entrepreneurship/management, essential to new economic enterprises resulting in innovation
6. Political and legal environment, encourages people to be economically productive, maintains stability

## Diminishing capital return

# Living standards
- GDP per capita is a good means of measuring change in living quality

## Factors that limit labor productivity
1. Human capital  
2. Physical capital  
3. Land and other natural resources  
4. Technology  
5. Entrepreneurship and management  
6. Political and legal environment
## Measuring change in living standards

## GDP growth rate
- This can be represented by compound interest (geometric sequence) 


# Aggregate demand,supply and inflation 
- Shows the relationship between short-run equilibrium output and the inflation rate 
- The curve reflects how short run equilibrium equals total planned expenditure in an economy 
- Increases in inflation reduce this planned spending so aggregate demand also slopes downwards
- The Keynesian model assumes output adjusts to meet demand at preset prices , it does not explain the behavior of inflation

>![[Pasted image 20220604133536.png]]

## Why aggregate demand slopes downwards 
- Distributional effects: inflation hurts lower incomes, since these people typically spend more output (Y) typically drops as well
- Uncertainty: inflation causes people to spend less when there's uncertainty regarding prices
- Exports: price of exported goods rises, lowering exports

# ADS with inflation 
- Inflation remains roughly constant if output remains the same and there are no external shocks to prices 
- Prices and wages are often set to what the public believes inflation will end up being which can also cause actual inflation

# Aggregate demand - supply diagram
- Short run aggregate supply (SRAS) as horizontal line showing current rate of inflation determined by ==past expectations and pricing decisions==
- Long run aggregate supply (LRAS) a vertical line showing potential output

# Self correcting economy 
- Economies self-correct in the long run
- The keynesian model does not account for a self correcting system and instead concentrates on the short-run with no price adjustment 
- Fiscal and monetary policy are most useful when attempting to eliminate large output gaps
## Slow self correcting 
- Fiscal and monetary policy can help stabilize the economy
## Fast self correcting
- Fiscal and monetary policy are not effective and may destabilize the economy
## Military spending

# Inflation / potential output shock 
- A sudden change in the normal behavior of inflation, unrelated to the national output gap

>![[Pasted image 20220604133046.png|400|400]]

- A sudden shock to output can both reduce supply and increase inflation
