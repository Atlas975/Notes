## Jacobian optimization
- In a simple system the Jacobian can be used to find a local maximum
>![[Pasted image 20211218081331.png]]
- Does not work for multiple maxima and minimas

- Global max/min is the tallest/deepest
- Local max/min are other corresponding highs and lows
- Jacobians dont have to point to the global, raising an issue
