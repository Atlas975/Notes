# Taylor series
- Allows to derive a function with same height/slope as a point of interest

- More coefficients mean a closer approximation in gradient, its not necessary for the line to be linear

- Functions are considered well behaved if they are continuous and can be differentiated infinitely.

- All terms here can be considered as having a factorial as the coefficient

*This is actually known as the Maclaurin Series*
