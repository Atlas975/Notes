## Inner product summary
- Symmetric only if B and C in the A matrix are identical
- Positive definitive, =0 ONLY IF X=0 when function is f(x,x)

## Distance between Vectors - Inner product
![[Pasted image 20220105115915.png|450|450]]
*sqrt(2x6) using [-2,2]
- This shows that the inner product can influence the distance between vectors
