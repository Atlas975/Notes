# Dimensionality reduction
- Reducing dimensionality can drastically reduce data complexity, decreasing memory usage and increasing algorithm speed.
- Example of redundant dimensions

- Both features are a unit of measurement making them directly correlated, these features can be simplified to a 1D plane

uses one number for each example
## 3D to 2D example

note the vector representing dimensions, this will always be equal to dimension the features are being reduced to.
## Dimensionality reduction for visualization of data
- Dimensionality reduction can be used to plot data on a 2D-3D plane to allow for data visualization.
- For example, compressing n features:

- Into 2 features:

- Allows for an easy to understand scatterplot to be drawn. New conclusions can also be drawn from the newly formed dimensions. For example, realizing the following:
