# Learning curves
- As more variables are added, error size increases

- Cross validation error teds to decrease, as more data tends to give a better hypothesis

## High bias setting
- Adding data does not help with correcting a learning curve in this scenario, for example:

## High variance (overfitting) setting
- Adding more data in this scenario does help, for example:
