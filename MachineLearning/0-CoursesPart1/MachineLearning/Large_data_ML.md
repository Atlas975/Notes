# Machine learning for large data sets
- Training on massive models can give good accuracy but comes at the cost of computation time, a possible solution is to try check if a lower number of training examples work just as well
- One example of checking this is to plot a learning curve for a range of sample sizes and verify that the algorithm has high variance when the sample size is still small.
- High variance (right) can be solved with more training examples , high bias (left) cannot.
