# Categorical data handling
- Â Categorical data refers to variables that contain label values rather than numerical values. 
- These labels can represent names, categories, or qualities and are often divided into two types: 
    -  **Nominal Data**: categories with no inherent order (e.g., gender, colour, city etc)
    - **Ordinal Data**: categories with a meaningful order but no fixed interval between them (e.g., ranking, education level etc.)
## Ordinal encoding
- Assumes ordering of categories
- Useful for giving different values distinct weights

## One-hot encoding
- No assumed ordering of categories (nominal values)
- Does not perform well when a large amount of possible categories are present.

- The boolean nature of this encoding scheme also gives it a high memory requirement, when analysing multiple sentences for example, vector dimensions will likely be too high
## Bag of words 
- Each element / document is a unordered collection of words, in this scenario a counter object is used to get the frequency of each words occurrence. 
- This typically used hashing possibly making the encoding process lengthy, however this does not suffer from the dimensionality growth rate that one-hot encoding does

- This has the advantage of having better similarity representation than one-hot but can also have the most common words dominate the count eg the,a,is
- [[Term_frequency-inverse_document_frequency|TF-IDF]] is a common solution to this
