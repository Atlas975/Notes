# Choosing lambda or degree of polynomial for a training set
- These are known as model selection problems
- A hypothesis fitting a training set well doesen't guarantee a good fit in terms of how well the hypothesis generalizes to new examples.
- Training error tends to decrease with the degree of the polynomial
