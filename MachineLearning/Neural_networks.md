- A powerful deep learning framework, operates by tuning the weights and bias parameters to minimize the cost function, activation layers are placed in a network style layout

[[Machine_learning_notation#Neural network notation]]

> w (weights) correspond to how strong a connection from one neuron to another is

> a (activation function) squishes the results of the weights and inputs so that the result is a value ranging between 0 and 1.

> b (bias) ensures that the result of the weight and input product is only meaningful after a certain threshold is met. It is added before squishing with an activation function and can be thought of as an additional neuron added to each layer
