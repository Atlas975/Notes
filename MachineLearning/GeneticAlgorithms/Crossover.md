# Crossover
- The process of chromosomes being recombined / crossed over to create the next iteration of chromosomes. Takes place after [[Selection|genetic selection]] and is used to potentially combine successful traits
- The frequency of this occurring is controlled by theÂ **crossover rate**. This needs to be high enough to combine successful traits while low enough to avoid losing the integrity of these traits
## K point crossover
