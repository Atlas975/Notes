# Generative adversarial networks
- A specialised [[Neural_networks|neural net]] designed for generating data that resembles it's training data, this is done in an adversarial setting where synthetic data must compete with real data
- GAN's make use of two models, a generator that creates new data and the discriminator that competes with it until it can be tricked by synthetic data

## Generator
- Tries to produce data that will be classified as real by the discriminator. The generatorâ€™s weights are adjusted based on how well it tricks the discriminator
- At the end of the training process the generator must be able to reliably fool the discriminator. The generator starts off with random 
## Discriminator
- Trained on a mixture of real data from the dataset and fake data from the generator. It must learn to correctly classify  in a way that maximises both the true positive and true negative rate
- Success in the generator component must also drive the discriminator to improve, this dynamic is what drives both networks to improve
