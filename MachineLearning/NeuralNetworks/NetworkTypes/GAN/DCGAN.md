# DCGAN
- A deep convolution [[Generative_adversarial_networks|GAN]] that makes use of [[Convolutional_networks|CNN]] layers and [[Transposed_convolution|Deconv]] layers
- Improves the stability and quality of the outputs generated by a standard GAN

## Generator
- Unlike traditional GANs that might use fully connected layers, the generator in a DCGAN uses deconv layers to produce an image from a seed of random noise
- Typically include batch [[Normalisation]] in both the generator and the discriminator. This normalises the input to each activation layer avoiding the exploding gradient problem 

## Discriminator 
- Uses [[Convolution|convolutional]] layers to classify images as real or fake, taking real data as input and downsampling it through several layers like a standard CNN to make classifications
- Like a discriminator in a standard GAN, this determines if an image is synthetic or not
