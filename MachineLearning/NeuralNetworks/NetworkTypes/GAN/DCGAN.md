# DCGAN
- A deep convolutional [[Generative_adversarial_networks|GAN]] that makes use of [[Convolutional_networks|convolutional]]  and [[Transposed_convolution|deconv]] layers. Able to leverage the benefits of conv layers such as parameter sharing and spatial hierarchies 
- This improves the stability and quality of the outputs generated by a standard GAN and is commonly used for creating high-quality, realistic images

## Generator
- Unlike traditional GANs that might use fully connected layers, the generator in a DCGAN uses deconv layers to produce an image from a seed of random noise
- Typically includes batch [[Normalisation]] for the generator and the discriminator. This normalises the input to each activation layer avoiding the exploding gradient problem 

## Discriminator 
- Uses [[Convolution|convolutional]] layers to classify images as real or fake, taking real data as input and downsampling through several layers like a standard CNN to make classifications
- Like a discriminator in a standard GAN, this determines if an image is synthetic or not
