# Conditional GAN
- A variation of [[Generative_adversarial_networks|GAN]] that allows control over generator output based on specific conditions (eg controlling the digit generated after training on the MNIST dataset)
- This is done by adding an additional input layer to G with values of onehot-encoded class labels alongside the randomised noise vector $z$ 
- This additional input layer is also added to D alongside the input data (real or synthetic).

## cGAN training
- Both G and D are taught simultaneously with the objective that G should generate data that looks real and satisfies the given condition
- Alongside making sure the data generated by G is realistic, D must also ensure that the data generated by G meets the given condition with the loss taking the condition into account

## Advantages and uses
- **Controlled Data Generation:** cGANs are very useful when you need to generate data with specific attributes (e.g., generating images of specific classes).
- **Domain translation**: Many problems in image processing, graphics, and vision involve translating an input image into a corresponding output image

- **Data Augmentation:** They can be used to create varied data samples for underrepresented classes in training datasets.
- **Multi-modal Data Synthesis:** cGANs can generate different outputs for the same input condition, useful in scenarios like different styles of handwriting for the same text.
- [[Semantic_segmentation|Semantic image synthesis]]: generating images based on semantic information understanding.
