# Conditional GAN
- A variation of [[Generative_adversarial_networks|GAN]] that allows control over generator output based on specific conditions (eg controlling the digit generated after training on the MNIST dataset)
- This is done by adding an additional input layer to both G and D

## cGAN training
- Both G and D are taught simultaneously with the objective that G should generate data that looks real and satisfies the given condition
- Alongside making sure the data generated by G is realistic, D must also ensure that the data generated by G meets the given condition via the loss taking the condition into account

## Advantages and uses
- **Controlled data generation:** cGANs are very useful for generating data with specific attributes 
- **Domain translation**: can translate images from one domain to another (eg summer to winter)

- **Data enhancement**: can generate high resolution images from low resolution input
- **Data augmentation:** can generate additional  samples for underrepresented classes in a dataset
- [[Semantic_segmentation|Semantic image synthesis]]: generating images based on semantic information understanding.
