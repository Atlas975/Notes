- When a matrix is stretched, the space around it changes as well. This scaling factor is known as the determinant

- In this example it means the area has been increased by a factor of 6
- Determinant is 0 if all space is squished into one line, this also means the columns are linearly dependent

- Negative determinents correspond to orientation

- Absolute value still gives the scale
