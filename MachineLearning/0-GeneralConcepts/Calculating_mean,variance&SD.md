# Calculating mean,variance and standard deviation
## Mean

- Population mean is usually generated using a small sample of data in large datasets

## Variance
- Terms are squared as it ensures each difference is positive

## Standard deviation

# Population estimate
- Since we rarely have the full set of data, variance, mean and sd usually use an estimate
## Estimated variance

- Not subtracting one would otherwise underestimate variance each time as the difference between data and sample mean tends to be smaller than that of population mean.
