# Pearson's correlation
[[Calculating_mean,variance&SD]]
- Represents the relationship between two variables

- This allows for prediction of one variable given another variable
>![[Pasted image 20220217140450.png|400|400]]
- Closer trend lines give better estimates

- Correlation of 1 indicates a straight line with a positive slope can go through all data
- More data means more confidence (lower p value)

- When correlation equals 0, X tells us nothing about Y

## P value in correlation

- The smaller the P value the more confidence we have in the predictions we make with the line
