# KNN clustering vs regression
- A KNN classifier is used to make a label classification for a given input X eg iris dataset, it simply outputs the label contained by the maximum number of k points.
- KNN regression is used to predict quantitative values used when the target value is numeric eg housing prices, selecting K points closest to the input X and returns the average of all those values
