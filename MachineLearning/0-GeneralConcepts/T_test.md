- Looks for significant differences in sets of data, for example in sample testing
- Two questions need to be asked before performing a t-test
1. is it a one or two tailed t-test?

2. is the data paired or unpaired
- example of paired and unpaired data:

## Symmetry proof

## T-test examples
1. Example of two tailed t-test with paired data
![[Pasted image 20220312085601.png|450|450]]
>indicates extremely high significance with low probability the data is randomly spread as such
2. Example of two tailed t-test with unpaired data
![[Pasted image 20220312085850.png|450|450]]
indicates low significance with an 8% chance of data being random
3. Example of two tailed t-test with unpaired data
![[Pasted image 20220312090426.png|450|450]]
indicates that theres a 53% chance data is just random and a 47% chance that theres statistical significance
