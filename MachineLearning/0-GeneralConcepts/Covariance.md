- A statistical tool used to determine the relationship between the movement of two random variables. Example:

## Calculating covariance

>![[Pasted image 20220217191834.png|400|400]]
values are negative since both variables are below the mean at that datapoint
- Covariance contribution

- Dividing by number of points gives final covariance

## Covariance summary
- Note the covariance does not tell us the slope of the line or how close the points are to the line, only that the relationship between the two variables is positive/negative/zero
- Covariance changes even if the relationship does not
